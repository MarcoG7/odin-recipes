        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is a sweet, moist quick bread or cake made with mashed bananas. It's known for its soft, tender crumb and rich banana flavor, often with hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. Many recipes incorporate nuts, chocolate chips, or other dried fruits, and it's a popular way to use up ripe bananas. </p>
